## Music
   My main extracurricular activity is music. I sing a lot and I can play the guitar, the piano, and drums. Additionally, I write practical exams at MUSON centre for contemporary and classical singing. The starter grade is grade 3 and I am currently on grade 7. I had also participated in a singing competition and won first place! Although I prefer to sing solos for schools that I am enrolled in, I also sing in my school and church choir. This has helped build my confidence and stage presence.

## Sports
   In addition, I play a lot of sports in my free time. Football is my favorite sport to play and watch. I participate in competitions with my team and whether we win or lose, we always have a fun time. Tennis is another sport that I grew to love because of my father. He trained my siblings and I and I always saw watching tennis matches as an opportunity to bond with him. My participation in sports has taught me leadership and teamwork skills that I use to pursue my passions and interests in the classroom.
